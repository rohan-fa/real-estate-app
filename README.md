# **Real Estate App**
## About the project
Real Estate Application visitors can buy, sell or rent. Visitors can easily filter their searches by type, location, price, and other predefined and custom criteria. Each property has a detailed description, community and property features, location, price, and a great image gallery. In addition, buyers of real estate can find contacts of sellers. 

### What  I have learned:
This project was merely a learning exercise and my first sizeable project delving into `NextJs` and `Supabase`.
